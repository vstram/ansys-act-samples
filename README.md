#Welcome to ansys-act-samples

In this repository you will find some ANSYS ACT sample code I am working on.

## Install

To install an ACT, please follow the procedure below:

1. Open the directory %APPDATA%\Ansys\v170\ACT\extensions in Windows Explorer
2. Copy the source code to this directory
3. Alternatively, you can copy the source code to any directory you want, and then include directories defined in the Additional Extension Folders field on the Extensions page of the Options dialog 

**Note:** In order the use a scripted ACT code, you'll need a valid ACT license.
